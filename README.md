# TO DO List Backend APi
  
## To Manage your day to day tasks.

This is a REST api built with nodejs, express and mongoDB.

The documentation of this API is in progress right now

Users can sign up/login and create, read, update and delete their tasks. A user can only see and interact with his own tasks, so that everyone's data remains safe.
For authentication, JWT tokens are used, hence users can use this app from multiple devices with no issues.

The testing is done with JEST. Any recommended changes to improve the app are welcome.
